description: <p>By using DCAT to describe datasets in data catalogs, publishers increase
  discoverability and enable applications easily to consume metadata from multiple
  catalogs. It further enables decentralized publishing of catalogs and facilitates
  federated dataset search across sites. Aggregated DCAT metadata can serve as a manifest
  file to facilitate digital preservation.</p>
