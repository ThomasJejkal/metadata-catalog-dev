description: <p>The CF standard was originally framed as a standard for data written
  in netCDF format, with model-generated climate forecast data particularly in mind.
  However, it is equally applicable to observational datasets, and can be used to
  describe other formats. It is a standard for &#8220;use metadata&#8221; that aims
  both to distinguish quantities (such as physical description, units, and prior processing)
  and to locate the data in space&#8211;time.</p><p>Sponsored by the NetCDF Climate
  and Forecast Metadata Convention, the current version dates from December 2011.</p>
