description: <p>The standard provides a means to publish multi-dimensional data, such
  as statistics, on the web in such a way that it can be linked to related data sets
  and concepts using the W3C RDF (Resource Description Framework) standard. The model
  underpinning the Data Cube vocabulary is compatible with the cube model that underlies
  SDMX (Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange), an ISO standard for exchanging and
  sharing statistical data and metadata among organizations.</p>
