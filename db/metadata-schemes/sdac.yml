description: <p>The Standard for Documentation of Astronomical Catalogues is a set
  of conventions for archiving astronomical data. As well as path, filename and data
  format conventions, it also specifies how to construct a plain text description
  file for documenting the data files. It was developed as an alternative to FITS
  that would be more suited to archives, permit human inspection, and allow manipulation
  via standard Unix command-line tools.</p> <p>SDAC was developed by CDS (Centre de
  Donn√©es astronomiques de Strasbourg). Version 2.0 is the most recent; it was released
  in February 2000.</p>
