description: <p>An information model for describing the elements of the heliophysics
  data environment, and a set of resource types which can be used to describe data
  along with its scientific context, source, provenance, content and location. It
  is designed to support a federated data system where data may reside at different
  locations and may be seperated from the metadata which describes it. The preferred
  expression form is XML.</p><p>The Space Physics Archive Search and Extract (SPASE)
  effort is implemented by the SPASE Consortium which is composed of representatives
  of the international Heliophysics data community. The Current Release of the data
  model (2.2.2) was updated in October 2012.</p>
