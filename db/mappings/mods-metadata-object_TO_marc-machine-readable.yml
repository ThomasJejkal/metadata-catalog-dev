description: This document is intended for use in first converting a MODS record to
  MARCXML and then to a MARC 21 (ISO 2709) record. MARC 21 includes many more data
  elements than MODS, so although this mapping suggests a single MARC 21 equivalent
  for each MODS element, there may be other equivalents that are more appropriate
  for particular pieces of information. Additionally, MARC 21 is more granular than
  MODS so some data may map to inappropriate MARC 21 fields or subfields. Consequently,
  some conversions will result in some loss of data identification.
