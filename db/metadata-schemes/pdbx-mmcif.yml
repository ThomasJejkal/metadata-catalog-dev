description: <p>Protein Data Bank archive (PDB) is the single worldwide archival repository
  of information about the 3D structures of proteins, nucleic acids, and complex assemblies,
  managed by the Worldwide PDB (wwPDB). The PDB Exchange Dictionary (PDBx) is used
  by the wwPDB to define data content for deposition, annotation and archiving of
  PDB entries. PDBx incorporates the community standard metadata representation, the
  Macromolecular Crystallographic Information Framework (mmCIF), orginally developed
  under the auspices of the International Union of Crystallography (IUCr). PDBx has
  been extended by the wwPDB to include descriptions of other experimental methods
  that produce 3D macromolecular structure models such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
  Spectroscopy, 3D Electron Microscopy and Tomography.</p>
