description: '<p>The technical specifications defined by the IVOA (International Virtual
  Observatory Alliance) enable interoperability between and the integration of astronomical
  archives across the world into an international virtual observatory. They include
  several data models that act as metadata schemas for particular data types: for
  example, photometry data, simulation data, space-time coordinates, spectral lines
  data, spectral data, observational data, and the physical parameter space of astronomical
  datasets.</p><p>These data models are under active development by the IVOA Data
  Modelling Working Group.</p><p>Additional recommendations have been made for metadata
  concepts and terms necessary for the discovery and the use of astronomical data
  collections and services.</p>'
