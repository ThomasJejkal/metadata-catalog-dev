description: <p>The OpenAIRE Guidelines are a suite of application profiles designed
  to allow research institutions to make their scholarly outputs visible through the
  OpenAIRE infrastructure. The profiles are based on established standards and designed
  to be used in conjunction with the OAI-PMH metadata harvesting protocol:</p><ul><li>The
  OpenAIRE Guidelines for Literature Repositories are based on Dublin Core;</li><li>The
  OpenAIRE Guidelines for Data Archives are based on the DataCite Metadata Schema;</li><li>The
  OpenAIRE Guidelines for CRIS Managers is based on CERIF.</li></ul><p>While the focus
  of each profile is different, they allow for interlinking and the contextualization
  of research artefacts.</p>
